# Interface Layer

The Interface Layer (Application Layer) in Clean Architecture should contain:

Use Cases (Commands and Queries): Application-specific business logic.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Objects for transferring data between layers.
Interfaces: Contracts for services and repositories.
Services: Business logic that spans multiple use cases.
Mappings: Conversions between domain entities and DTOs.
