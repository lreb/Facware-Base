# Domain Layer

The Domain Layer in Clean Architecture should contain:

Entities: Core business objects with identity and business logic.
Value Objects: Immutable objects defined by their attributes.
Interfaces: Contracts for services and repositories.
Domain Services: Business logic that spans multiple entities.
Domain Events: Events representing something that has happened in the domain.
Exceptions: Custom exceptions for business rule violations.
By keeping the Domain Layer free of dependencies on external frameworks and technologies, you ensure that your business logic remains pure and testable.
